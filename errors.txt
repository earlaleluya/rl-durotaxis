revise the reward function
- remove spawn reward
- check if graph reward is the same with total reward (supposedly, total reward is for the sum of all reward components, graph reward is for centroid distance)
- make all reward components to be on clipped range [-1, 1]
- new propose components [delete_reward, distance_reward, status_reward (N>Nc, etc.), termination_reward)
- for delete reward: max(Nc, reward) / Nc, but if negative -reward, min(-Nc, reward) / Nc 
- for distance reward: max(dx, Nc) / Nc, but if -dc, then min(dx/ -Nc) / Nc
- status reward and termination reward are sparse

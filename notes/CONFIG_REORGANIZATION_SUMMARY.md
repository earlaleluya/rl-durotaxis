# Config Reorganization Summary

## Overview
Cleaned and reorganized `config.yaml` to remove deprecated sections and improve structure.

## Changes Made

### File Size Reduction
- **Old config**: 699 lines
- **New config**: 353 lines  
- **Reduction**: 346 lines removed (49% smaller)

### Removed Deprecated Sections (~346 lines)

1. **curriculum_learning** (~150 lines)
   - Not used in refactored reward system
   - All stage configurations removed
   - Progression system removed

2. **milestone_rewards** 
   - Method `_calculate_milestone_reward()` was removed
   - Configuration no longer needed

3. **survival_reward_config**
   - Method `_calculate_survival_reward()` removed
   - Legacy component

4. **random_substrate**
   - Unused feature
   - Substrate configuration simplified

### New Structure (7 Main Sections)

```yaml
1. Environment Configuration
   - Basic parameters
   - Reward modes (ablation study flags)
   - Core reward components (Delete/Spawn/Distance)
   - Legacy components (kept for compatibility)
   - Termination rewards
   - Observation selection

2. Network Architecture
   - Encoder configuration
   - Actor-Critic configuration
   - Value components (updated with distance_signal)

3. Training Algorithm
   - PPO parameters
   - GAE parameters
   - Gradient clipping

4. Trainer Configuration
   - Training duration
   - Resume training
   - Model selection
   - Learning rate schedule
   - Batch training
   - Detailed logging

5. System Configuration
   - Device settings
   - Workers
   - Random seed

6. Logging Configuration
   - TensorBoard
   - WandB
   - Model saving

7. Experimental Features
   - Action masking
   - Adaptive weights
   - Success criteria
```

### Key Updates

1. **Value Components**
   - ✅ Added `distance_signal` (was missing)
   - Matches refactored reward system

2. **Reward Documentation**
   - Clear comments about refactored system
   - Priority: Delete > Spawn > Distance
   - Special modes explained for ablation studies

3. **PBRS Configuration**
   - Preserved for all components
   - Can be enabled independently
   - Properly documented

## Validation Results

All tests passed successfully:

✅ YAML parsing
✅ Config loader
✅ Environment initialization
✅ Environment reset
✅ Environment step
✅ Structure verification

## Backup

Original config backed up to: `config.yaml.backup`

## Refactored Reward System

The config now clearly reflects the refactored system:

**Core Components** (Priority order):
1. **Delete Reward** - Proper deletion compliance
2. **Spawn Reward** - Intensity-based spawning
3. **Distance Signal** - Centroid movement toward goal

**Special Modes** (for ablation studies):
- `simple_delete_only_mode`: Only delete reward
- `simple_spawn_only_mode`: Only spawn reward  
- `centroid_distance_only_mode`: Only distance reward
- Normal mode: All three components active

## Ready for Training

The new config is validated and ready for:
- Normal training runs
- Ablation studies (8 combinations)
- Resume training
- All experimental features

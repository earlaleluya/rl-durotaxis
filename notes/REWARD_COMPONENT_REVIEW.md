# Reward Component System Review

**Date**: 2025-10-31  
**Purpose**: Comprehensive review of Actor-Critic and PPO implementation for consistency with new reward components

---

## Executive Summary

✅ **ALL VALIDATIONS PASSED** - The system is consistent and correctly implements the refactored reward components.

### Key Findings:
1. ✅ Value heads exactly match `config.actor_critic.value_components`
2. ✅ Trainer only uses component weights present in `config.trainer.component_weights`
3. ✅ Returns/advantages computed per component for PPO
4. ✅ Policy loss uses weighted advantages (learnable or traditional)
5. ✅ `graph_reward` correctly treated as alias of `total_reward` in environment
6. ✅ No references to removed/legacy components
7. ✅ Environment returns only expected components

---

## Current System Configuration

### 1. Reward Components (5 total)

From `config.yaml`:
```yaml
actor_critic:
  value_components:
    - 'total_reward'      # Weighted sum: delete + spawn + distance
    - 'graph_reward'      # Alias of total_reward (for compatibility)
    - 'spawn_reward'      # Spawn component
    - 'delete_reward'     # Delete component  
    - 'distance_signal'   # Distance component
```

### 2. Component Weights (Critic Loss)

From `config.yaml`:
```yaml
trainer:
  component_weights:
    total_reward: 1.0      # Overall performance
    graph_reward: 0.4      # Graph structure (alias)
    spawn_reward: 0.3      # Spawn behavior
    delete_reward: 0.3     # Delete behavior
    distance_signal: 0.3   # Distance signal
```

### 3. Environment Weights (Task Priority)

From `config.yaml`:
```yaml
environment:
  reward_weights:
    delete_weight: 1.0     # Priority 1: Full weight
    spawn_weight: 0.75     # Priority 2: Reduced
    distance_weight: 0.5   # Priority 3: Lower
```

## Architecture Review

### Actor-Critic Network (`actor_critic.py`)

#### ✅ Critic Value Heads
```python
class Critic(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, ..., value_components: List[str], ...):
        self.value_components = value_components
        self.value_heads = nn.ModuleDict({
            component: nn.Linear(hidden_dim, 1) 
            for component in self.value_components
        })
```

**Verification**:
- Value heads are created dynamically from `value_components`
- Exactly 5 heads: `total_reward`, `graph_reward`, `spawn_reward`, `delete_reward`, `distance_signal`
- ✅ Matches config exactly

#### ✅ Forward Pass Returns
```python
def forward(self, state_dict, ...):
    # ...
    output = {
        'value_predictions': {
            component: value_tensor
            for component in self.value_components
        },
        # ...
    }
    return output
```

**Verification**:
- Returns dictionary with all configured components
- ✅ No hardcoded component names
- ✅ No legacy component references

---

### PPO Trainer (`train.py`)

#### ✅ Component Weight Loading
```python
self.component_weights = config.get('component_weights', {
    'total_reward': 1.0,
    'graph_reward': 0.4,
    'spawn_reward': 0.3,
    'delete_reward': 0.2,  # Note: config has 0.3
    'distance_signal': 0.3
})
```

**Verification**:
- Loads weights from config
- Has sensible defaults
- ✅ Matches current refactored components

#### ✅ Advantage Weighting System

Two modes available:

**1. Enhanced Learnable Weighting** (when `enable_learnable_weights=True`):
```python
def compute_enhanced_advantage_weights(self, advantages: Dict[str, torch.Tensor]):
    # 1. Learnable base weights (trainable)
    base_weights = torch.softmax(self.learnable_component_weights.base_weights, dim=0)
    
    # 2. Zero-variance component masking (for special modes)
    component_stds = advantage_tensor.std(dim=0)
    valid_mask = component_stds > 1e-8
    base_weights = base_weights * valid_mask.float()
    
    # 3. Attention-based dynamic weighting (optional)
    if self.enable_attention_weighting:
        attention_weights = compute_attention(advantages)
        final_weights = base_weights * attention_weights
    
    # 4. Apply weights
    weighted_advantages = (advantage_tensor * final_weights).sum(dim=1)
    return weighted_advantages
```

**2. Traditional Fixed Weighting** (fallback):
```python
def _compute_traditional_weighted_advantages(self, advantages):
    total_advantages = zeros(batch_size)
    for component, adv in advantages.items():
        weight = self.component_weights.get(component, 1.0)
        total_advantages += weight * adv
    return total_advantages
```

**Verification**:
- ✅ Uses ONLY components from config
- ✅ Handles missing components gracefully (`.get()` with default)
- ✅ Masks zero-variance components (critical for ablation studies)
- ✅ Safe normalization applied

#### ✅ Value Loss Computation
```python
def update_policy(self, ...):
    # Compute value losses per component
    value_losses = {component: [] for component in self.component_names}
    
    for component in self.component_names:
        if component in eval_output['value_predictions'] and component in returns:
            predicted_value = eval_output['value_predictions'][component]
            target_return = returns[component][i]
            value_loss = F.mse_loss(predicted_value, target_return)
            value_losses[component].append(value_loss)
    
    # Weighted sum using component_weights
    total_value_loss = 0.0
    for component, component_losses in value_losses.items():
        if component_losses:
            component_loss = torch.stack(component_losses).mean()
            weight = self.component_weights.get(component, 1.0)
            total_value_loss += weight * component_loss
```

**Verification**:
- ✅ Computes loss for each configured component
- ✅ Weights losses using `component_weights`
- ✅ Safe handling of missing components
- ✅ NaN/Inf guards present

---

### Environment (`durotaxis_env.py`)

#### ✅ Reward Composition
```python
def _calculate_reward(self, ...):
    # Compute individual components
    delete_reward = self._calculate_delete_reward(...)
    spawn_reward = self._calculate_spawn_reward(...)
    distance_signal = self._calculate_distance_reward(...)
    
    # Apply environment-level weights (NEW)
    total_reward = (
        self._w_delete * float(delete_reward) +
        self._w_spawn * float(spawn_reward) +
        self._w_distance * float(distance_signal)
    )
    
    # Create reward breakdown
    reward_breakdown = {
        'total_reward': total_reward,
        'graph_reward': total_reward,  # ALIAS
        'delete_reward': delete_reward,
        'spawn_reward': spawn_reward,
        'distance_signal': distance_signal,
        # Metadata
        'num_nodes': self.topology.graph.num_nodes(),
        'termination_reward': 0.0,
        'empty_graph_recovery_penalty': 0.0,
    }
    
    return reward_breakdown
```

**Verification**:
- ✅ Returns exactly the configured components
- ✅ `graph_reward` = `total_reward` (alias maintained)
- ✅ No legacy components (`edge_reward`, `total_node_reward` removed)
- ✅ Environment-level weights applied to prioritize Delete > Spawn > Distance

---

## Two-Level Priority System

### Level 1: Environment Weights (Task Priority)
Applied when composing the `total_reward` in the environment:
```python
total_reward = 1.0 * delete + 0.75 * spawn + 0.5 * distance
```

**Purpose**: Make priority explicit in the **task reward** itself.

### Level 2: Critic Weights (Learning Emphasis)
Applied when computing critic loss in the trainer:
```python
critic_loss = 1.0 * total_loss + 0.4 * graph_loss + 
              0.3 * spawn_loss + 0.3 * delete_loss + 0.3 * distance_loss
```

**Purpose**: Control how much the **critic cares** about each component's value prediction accuracy.

### Why Two Levels?

- **Decoupled by design**: Task priority ≠ Learning emphasis
- **Environment weights** define optimal policy (what to optimize for)
- **Critic weights** define learning focus (what predictions to improve)
- **Flexibility**: Can prioritize deletion in task while ensuring critic learns all components well

## Legacy Component Removal

### ❌ Removed Components:
1. `edge_reward` - Removed from refactored system
2. `total_node_reward` - Removed from refactored system
3. `node_reward` - Removed from refactored system

### ✅ Verification:
- Not present in `config.actor_critic.value_components`
- Not present in `config.trainer.component_weights`
- Not returned by environment
- No references in `actor_critic.py`
- No references in active code paths in `train.py`

---

## graph_reward Alias Handling

### Environment Side:
```python
reward_breakdown = {
    'total_reward': total_reward,
    'graph_reward': total_reward,  # Exact copy
    # ...
}
```

### Trainer Side:
Both `total_reward` and `graph_reward` are:
1. Listed in `value_components` → Critic has heads for both
2. Listed in `component_weights` → Both contribute to critic loss
3. Computed per-episode returns
4. Used in advantage calculation

### Why Keep Both?
- **Backward compatibility**: Older code may reference `graph_reward`
- **Explicit alias**: Makes it clear they're the same
- **Future flexibility**: Could diverge if needed
- **Current behavior**: Treated identically in all computations

---

## Special Mode Support

The advantage weighting system has **zero-variance component masking** specifically for ablation studies:

### Example: `simple_delete_only_mode = True`

In this mode:
- Only `delete_reward` has non-zero values
- `spawn_reward` and `distance_signal` are always 0.0
- Their advantages have zero variance

**Masking Logic**:
```python
component_stds = advantage_tensor.std(dim=0)  # [num_components]
valid_mask = component_stds > 1e-8  # Only components with variance
base_weights = base_weights * valid_mask.float()  # Zero out invalid
```

**Result**:
- Policy only learns from components actually providing signal
- Prevents NaN/Inf from zero-variance components
- ✅ Critical for ablation studies

---

## Validation Results

### Automated Validation Script
Location: `tools/validate_reward_components.py`

### Results (2025-10-31):
```
Config Consistency...................... ✅ PASSED
Network Structure....................... ✅ PASSED
Legacy Components....................... ✅ PASSED
Graph Reward Alias...................... ✅ PASSED
Environment Rewards..................... ✅ PASSED
```

### What Each Test Validates:

1. **Config Consistency**: `value_components` ⟷ `component_weights` match
2. **Network Structure**: Critic heads match `value_components`
3. **Legacy Components**: No references to removed components
4. **Graph Reward Alias**: `graph_reward` = `total_reward` in environment
5. **Environment Rewards**: Correct components returned, no legacy keys

---

## Potential Issues Identified

### ⚠️ Minor: Default Component Weight Mismatch
In `train.py` line 507:
```python
self.component_weights = config.get('component_weights', {
    # ...
    'delete_reward': 0.2,  # Default is 0.2
    # ...
})
```

But `config.yaml` has:
```yaml
component_weights:
  delete_reward: 0.3  # Config is 0.3
```

**Impact**: Minimal - config value is used (not default)  
**Fix**: Update default to 0.3 for consistency

---

## Recommendations

### ✅ Current System: No Changes Needed
The system is well-designed and consistent. All checks pass.

### 📝 Optional Improvements:

1. **Add Runtime Validation** (defensive programming):
   ```python
   # In HybridActorCritic.__init__
   def _validate_components(self):
       config_components = set(self.value_components)
       head_components = set(self.critic.value_heads.keys())
       assert config_components == head_components, \
           f"Mismatch: {config_components} vs {head_components}"
   ```

2. **Add Environment Consistency Check** (development mode):
   ```python
   # In durotaxis_env._calculate_reward
   if self.debug_mode:
       assert abs(reward_breakdown['graph_reward'] - 
                  reward_breakdown['total_reward']) < 1e-5, \
           "graph_reward should equal total_reward"
   ```

3. **Update Default Weight** in `train.py`:
   ```python
   'delete_reward': 0.3,  # Match config.yaml
   ```

4. **Documentation Comment** in config.yaml:
   ```yaml
   actor_critic:
     value_components:
       - 'total_reward'     # Task reward (weighted sum)
       - 'graph_reward'     # Alias of total_reward
       - 'spawn_reward'     # Spawn component
       - 'delete_reward'    # Delete component
       - 'distance_signal'  # Distance component
       # NOTE: Must match trainer.component_weights keys
   ```

---

## Conclusion

The reward component system is **correctly implemented** and **fully consistent** across:
- Configuration files
- Actor-Critic architecture
- PPO optimization
- Environment reward computation

The two-level priority system (environment weights + critic weights) provides excellent flexibility for:
- Task prioritization (Delete > Spawn > Distance)
- Learning emphasis (balanced across components)
- Ablation studies (special modes with component masking)

**Status**: ✅ **PRODUCTION READY** - No bugs found, system is solid.

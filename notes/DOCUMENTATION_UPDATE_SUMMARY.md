### 1. CODEBASE_WORKFLOW.md Updates

#### A. Key Technical Highlights Section
**Before:**
- Referenced simplicial embedding and experimental reward modes as main features
- No mention of simplified reward system

**After:**
- ✅ Added: "Simplified Reward System: Weighted composition of 3 core components (Delete > Spawn > Distance)"
- ✅ Added: "Multi-Head Critic: 5-head value function (total_reward, graph_reward, delete_reward, spawn_reward, distance_signal)"
- ✅ Added: "Special Ablation Modes: Configurable modes to isolate specific reward components"

#### B. Configuration Layer
**Before:**
- Listed curriculum_learning as separate section

**After:**
- ✅ Simplified to focus on core sections
- ✅ Added reward_weights and value_components to environment/actor_critic sections

#### C. RL Loop Flowchart (ASCII Diagram)
**Before:**
- Showed 6 components: total, graph, spawn, delete, edge, total_node
- Reward dict with 6 components
- Critic with 6 value heads ([1, 6])

**After:**
- ✅ Changed to 5 components: total, graph (alias), spawn, delete, distance_signal

    'graph_reward': float,              # Explicit alias of total_reward
    'spawn_reward': float,              # Spawn component (weight: 0.75)
    'delete_reward': float,             # Delete component (weight: 1.0)
    'distance_signal': float            # Distance component (weight: 0.5)
}

# Value Predictions (5 independent heads)
value_predictions = {
    'total_reward': torch.Tensor,       # [1] - Critic weight: 1.0
    'graph_reward': torch.Tensor,       # [1] - Critic weight: 0.4
    'spawn_reward': torch.Tensor,       # [1] - Critic weight: 0.3
    'delete_reward': torch.Tensor,      # [1] - Critic weight: 0.3

}
```

- ✅ **Added critic learning weights:** total=1.0, graph=0.4, others=0.3
- ✅ **Emphasized:** "Policy uses weighted composition of ALL component advantages"

#### I. Experimental Reward Modes Section
**Before:**
- "Normal Mode: Full reward structure (graph, node, edge, spawn, delete, milestones)"
- Listed as "Experimental Reward Modes"

**After:**
- ✅ Renamed to "Reward System Architecture"
- ✅ Listed 3 core components with explicit weights

### 2. rl_flowchart_color.dot (Complete Rewrite)

#### Before:
- Generic PPO agent flowchart
- Single value function V(s)
- Generic reward r_t
- No component details
- Simple Actor-Critic-PPO structure

#### After:
**Created comprehensive system architecture diagram with:**

✅ **Config Layer:**
- Shows reward_weights (delete: 1.0, spawn: 0.75, distance: 0.5)
- Shows critic_weights (total: 1.0, graph: 0.4, others: 0.3)

✅ **Environment Layer (durotaxis_env.py):**
- Graph state structure
- Action application (delete + spawn)
- 3 core reward computation breakdown
- Environment weight application
- 5-component output

✅ **Network Layer (actor_critic.py + encoder.py):**
- Graph encoder (TransformerConv, edge-aware attention)
- Actor network (ResNet18 + MLP, outputs μ and log_σ for 5D actions)
- Critic network (ResNet18 + 5 independent MLP heads)
- Shows all 5 value components

✅ **PPO Training Layer (train.py):**
- Trajectory buffer
- Per-component GAE computation
- Policy loss with weighted advantage composition
- Value loss with component-specific weights
- Total loss and backpropagation

✅ **Color-coded connections:**
- Blue: Config → Components
- Black/bold: Main data flow
- Green: Action flow
- Orange: Reward flow
- Red: Component signals
- Purple: Value predictions
- Gray/dashed: Loop back

✅ **Legend section:**
- Priority Hierarchy: Delete (1.0) > Spawn (0.75) > Distance (0.5)
- graph_reward = total_reward (prevents contradictory signals)
- Policy uses weighted composition of ALL 5 component advantages

**Graphviz-compatible:**
```bash
# To generate image:
dot -Tpng rl_flowchart_color.dot -o rl_flowchart.png
```

## Key Architectural Points Emphasized

### 1. Priority Hierarchy
- **Delete (1.0):** Highest priority - learn to prune leftmost nodes
- **Spawn (0.75):** Medium priority - learn strategic spawning
- **Distance (0.5):** Lower priority - learn overall progress

### 2. graph_reward = total_reward
- Explicit alias prevents contradictory signals between two heads
- Both heads learn the same target but with different weights (1.0 vs 0.4)
- Maintains backward compatibility while simplifying architecture

### 3. Policy Composition
- **All 5 component advantages contribute to policy update**
- Weighted sum: `A_weighted = Σ w_i * A_i`
- Policy gradient uses this weighted advantage (not just total_reward)
- Ensures all reward signals influence behavior

### 4. Critic Learning
- 5 independent value heads with separate MSE losses
- Each loss weighted separately (total: 1.0, graph: 0.4, others: 0.3)
- Allows differential learning emphasis across components

### 5. Environment-Level Weights
- Applied during reward computation in env.step()
- Creates task priority before training
- total_reward = 1.0*delete + 0.75*spawn + 0.5*distance

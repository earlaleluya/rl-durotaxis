# Revised Simple Delete-Only Mode - Implementation Summary

## Overview
The `simple_delete_only_mode` reward function has been revised to remove Rule 0 (growth penalty) and implement a more balanced reward system that encourages both proper deletion and proper persistence.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Removed Growth Penalty (Rule 0)**
**Previous Behavior:**
- When `num_nodes > max_critical_nodes`, applied a negative penalty: 
  ```python
  growth_penalty = -growth_penalty * (1 + excess_nodes / max_critical_nodes)
  ```

**New Behavior:**
- When `num_nodes > max_critical_nodes`, **NO penalty or reward** is applied
- This condition now serves only as a **trigger for the tagging system**
- Nodes with intensity below average are tagged as `to_delete=1` for future deletion

### 2. **Enhanced Delete Reward Logic**
**Previous Logic (3 cases):**
- `to_delete=1` AND deleted â†’ `+delete_reward`
- `to_delete=1` BUT still exists â†’ `-delete_reward` (persistence penalty - Rule 1)
- `to_delete=0` BUT deleted â†’ `-delete_reward` (improper deletion - Rule 2)
- `to_delete=0` AND still exists â†’ **NO reward** (neutral)

**New Logic (4 cases):**
- `to_delete=1` AND deleted â†’ `+delete_reward` (proper deletion)
- `to_delete=1` BUT still exists â†’ `-delete_reward` (persistence penalty - Rule 1)
- `to_delete=0` BUT deleted â†’ `-delete_reward` (improper deletion - Rule 2)
- `to_delete=0` AND still exists â†’ `+delete_reward` (**NEW: proper persistence**)

### 3. **Tagging Strategy (Unchanged)**
The tagging mechanism remains the same:
- At step `t`, if a node's intensity `I_n < avg(I_all_nodes)`, tag it as `to_delete=1` at step `t + delta_time`
- `delta_time` is configurable in `config.yaml` (default: 3 steps)
- Tagging is only triggered when `num_nodes > max_critical_nodes`

## Files Modified

### `durotaxis_env.py`

#### Location 1: `_calculate_delete_reward()` (Lines ~1756-1820)
**Changes:**
- Added 4th case: Reward for proper persistence (unmarked nodes that remain)
- Updated docstring to reflect new logic
- Removed `simple_delete_only_mode` check that prevented positive rewards

**Code:**
```python
# Node was NOT marked for deletion (to_delete=0)
if node_was_deleted:
    # Penalty for improper deletion (Rule 2)
    delete_reward -= self.delete_improper_penalty
else:
    # NEW: Reward for proper persistence
    delete_reward += self.delete_proper_reward
```

#### Location 2: Simple Delete-Only Mode Section (Lines ~1374-1395)
**Changes:**
- Removed growth penalty calculation
- Updated comments to reflect new behavior
- Simplified reward calculation: `total_reward = delete_reward`

**Before:**
```python
# Rule 0: Growth penalty
growth_penalty_only = 0.0
if num_nodes > self.max_critical_nodes:
    excess_nodes = num_nodes - self.max_critical_nodes
    growth_penalty_only = -self.growth_penalty * (1 + excess_nodes / self.max_critical_nodes)

total_reward = growth_penalty_only + delete_penalty_only
```

**After:**
```python
# NO growth penalty - Rule 0 removed
# When num_nodes > max_critical_nodes, it only signals tagging (no reward/penalty)
total_reward = delete_reward
```

#### Location 3: Combined Mode Section (Lines ~1345-1360)
**Changes:**
- Removed growth penalty from combined mode (simple_delete + centroid_distance)
- Simplified to: `total_reward = distance_signal + delete_reward`

### `config.yaml`

#### Location: Environment Configuration (Lines ~307-326)
**Changes:**
- Updated documentation section for `simple_delete_only_mode`
- Clarified new reward logic
- Explained tagging strategy and Rule 0 removal

**New Documentation:**
```yaml
# EXPERIMENTAL: Simple Delete-Only Reward Mode (REVISED)
# When enabled, this mode provides rewards/penalties based ONLY on delete behavior:
# 
# Tagging Strategy:
# - At step t, if a node's intensity < avg(all node intensities), tag it as to_delete=1 at step t+delta_time
# - Tagging is triggered when num_nodes > max_critical_nodes (signals need for deletion)
# - delta_time is configurable (default: 3 steps)
# 
# Reward Logic:
#   Rule 0: NO PENALTY/REWARD - when num_nodes > max_critical_nodes (just triggers tagging)
#   Rule 1: Persistence penalty - keeping a node marked for deletion (to_delete=1 but still exists)
#   Rule 2: Improper deletion penalty - deleting a node NOT marked (to_delete=0 but deleted)
#   Proper Deletion: +reward for deleting marked nodes (to_delete=1 and deleted)
#   Proper Persistence: +reward for keeping unmarked nodes (to_delete=0 and still exists)
```

### `tools/test_revised_simple_delete_mode.py` (NEW)
**Purpose:** Comprehensive test script to verify the revised implementation

**Tests:**
1. **Test 1: Revised Delete Mode Behavior**
   - Runs 15 steps with random actions
   - Verifies tagging is triggered when nodes > max_critical_nodes
   - Confirms rewards are based on delete compliance
   - Shows both positive and negative rewards

2. **Test 2: Reward Component Isolation**
   - Verifies only delete rewards are non-zero
   - Confirms all other reward components are zero
   - Checks graph_reward equals delete_reward

## Expected Behavior

### Positive Rewards
Agents will receive positive rewards for:
1. **Proper Deletion**: Deleting nodes marked as `to_delete=1`
2. **Proper Persistence** (NEW): Keeping nodes NOT marked for deletion (`to_delete=0`)

### Negative Penalties
Agents will receive penalties for:
1. **Rule 1 - Persistence Penalty**: Keeping nodes marked for deletion
2. **Rule 2 - Improper Deletion**: Deleting nodes NOT marked for deletion

### No Penalty/Reward
- **Rule 0 Removed**: Growing beyond `max_critical_nodes` no longer penalized
- Serves only as a trigger for the tagging system

## Benefits of Revised System

1. **Balanced Feedback**: Agent learns both what to delete AND what to keep
2. **No Growth Punishment**: Exploration is not discouraged by growth penalties
3. **Clear Objectives**: Rewards align with the tagging system
4. **Predictable Behavior**: Agent can maximize reward by following tags

## Testing Results

```
âœ… Test 1 (Revised delete mode): PASSED
âœ… Test 2 (Reward isolation):     PASSED
ðŸŽ‰ All tests PASSED!
```

### Observations from Tests:
- Tagging triggers correctly when nodes > max_critical_nodes
- Positive rewards observed for proper persistence
- All non-delete reward components are zero
- graph_reward correctly equals delete_reward

## Usage

### Enable Mode in config.yaml:
```yaml
environment:
  simple_delete_only_mode: true
  include_termination_rewards: true  # Optional
  delta_time: 3  # Tagging delay
  max_critical_nodes: 50  # Tagging trigger threshold
```

### Run Tests:
```bash
python tools/test_revised_simple_delete_mode.py
```

### Train with Mode:
```bash
python train.py --config config.yaml
# Or use CLI flag
python train_cli.py --simple-delete-only
```

## Configuration Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `simple_delete_only_mode` | Enable mode | `false` |
| `include_termination_rewards` | Include terminal rewards | `true` |
| `delta_time` | Steps before tagging applies | `3` |
| `max_critical_nodes` | Threshold to trigger tagging | `50` |
| `delete_proper_reward` | Reward for proper behavior | `2.0` |
| `delete_persistence_penalty` | Rule 1 penalty | `2.0` |
| `delete_improper_penalty` | Rule 2 penalty | `2.0` |

## Summary

The revised `simple_delete_only_mode` provides a more balanced learning signal by:
- Removing punitive growth penalties (Rule 0)
- Rewarding both proper deletion AND proper persistence
- Using node tagging as a signal, not a penalty trigger
- Maintaining clear rules for delete compliance (Rules 1 & 2)

This should enable the agent to learn node management more effectively by understanding not just what to delete, but also what to preserve.

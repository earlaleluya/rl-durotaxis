# PBRS Centroid Fix - Verification Report

**Date**: 2025-10-31  
**Status**: ✅ **ALL BUGS FIXED AND VALIDATED**

## Overview

Fixed two critical bugs in the centroid PBRS (Potential-Based Reward Shaping) implementation that prevented it from working in the refactored reward system.

## Problems Identified

### 1. **Centroid Potential Function Bug**
- **Issue**: `_phi_centroid_distance_potential()` was reading `centroid_x` from wrong location
- **Root Cause**: State dict doesn't explicitly include `centroid_x` field; it's stored in `graph_features[3]`
- **Impact**: PBRS potential always returned 0.0, making centroid shaping inactive

### 2. **PBRS Integration Bug**
- **Issue**: Centroid PBRS shaping term never added to `distance_signal`
- **Root Cause**: Refactored `_calculate_reward()` bypassed `_calculate_centroid_movement_reward()` which contained PBRS logic
- **Impact**: Even with `_pbrs_centroid_enabled=True`, no shaping was applied

## Fixes Applied

### Patch 1: Fix Centroid Potential Reading

**Location**: `durotaxis_env.py`, lines 1462-1506  
**Function**: `_phi_centroid_distance_potential(state)`

**Changes**:
```python
# OLD (broken):
centroid_x = state.get('centroid_x', 0.0)  # Always returns 0.0
goal_x = state.get('goal_x', 1.0)  # Wrong fallback

# NEW (fixed):
# Prefer explicit field, else derive from graph_features
if 'centroid_x' in state and state['centroid_x'] is not None:
    centroid_x = float(state['centroid_x'])
else:
    gf = state.get('graph_features', None)
    if isinstance(gf, torch.Tensor) and gf.numel() >= 4:
        centroid_x = float(gf[3].item())  # Extract from tensor
    elif isinstance(gf, (list, tuple)) and len(gf) >= 4:
        centroid_x = float(gf[3])  # Extract from list
    else:
        return 0.0

goal_x = float(getattr(self, 'goal_x', self.substrate.width - 1))  # Correct source
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Reads centroid from `graph_features[3]` (correct location)
- ✅ Handles tensor, list, and explicit field formats
- ✅ Uses actual `self.goal_x` attribute (substrate width - 1)
- ✅ Device-agnostic (works on CPU/GPU)

### Patch 2: Integrate PBRS into Distance Signal

**Location**: `durotaxis_env.py`, lines 1031-1047  
**Function**: `_calculate_reward()` distance signal calculation

**Changes**:
```python
# Calculate base distance signal (delta or static)
if self.dm_use_delta and self._prev_centroid_x is not None and self.goal_x > 0:
    delta_x = centroid_x - self._prev_centroid_x
    distance_signal = self.dm_dist_scale * (delta_x / self.goal_x)
else:
    if self.goal_x > 0:
        distance_signal = -(self.goal_x - centroid_x) / self.goal_x
    else:
        distance_signal = 0.0

# NEW: Optional PBRS shaping on top (preserves optimal policy)
if self._pbrs_centroid_enabled and self._pbrs_centroid_coeff != 0.0:
    phi_prev = self._phi_centroid_distance_potential(prev_state)
    phi_new = self._phi_centroid_distance_potential(new_state)
    distance_signal += self._pbrs_centroid_coeff * (self._pbrs_gamma * phi_new - phi_prev)
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Adds PBRS term: `coeff * (gamma * Phi(s') - Phi(s))`
- ✅ Preserves optimal policy (proven by PBRS theory)
- ✅ Works with both delta and static distance modes
- ✅ Only applied when explicitly enabled (`_pbrs_centroid_enabled=True`)

## Validation Results

### Test Suite 1: Refactored System Tests
**Command**: `python tools/test_refactored_system.py`  
**Result**: ✅ **5/5 tests passed**

- ✓ Default Mode Uses 3 Core Components
- ✓ Legacy Components Zeroed
- ✓ No Spawn Boundary Checks
- ✓ Special Modes Still Work
- ✓ Priority Order (Delete > Spawn > Distance)

### Test Suite 2: PBRS Centroid Fix Tests
**Command**: `python tools/test_pbrs_centroid_fix.py`  
**Result**: ✅ **3/3 tests passed**

1. **Centroid Potential Reading**: Validates extraction from `graph_features`
   - Tensor format: ✓ (typical case)
   - List format: ✓ (fallback)
   - Explicit field: ✓ (legacy)

2. **PBRS Integration**: Validates shaping term added to distance_signal
   - PBRS disabled: distance_signal = -0.9425
   - PBRS enabled: distance_signal = +17.3346
   - **Difference**: 18.28 (PBRS working!)

3. **Device-Agnostic**: Validates CPU/GPU compatibility
   - CPU tensor: ✓ phi = -449.0
   - CUDA tensor: ✓ (if available)

## Reward System Verification

### Normal Mode (No Special Flags)
- ✅ **Total reward** = delete_reward + spawn_reward + distance_signal
- ✅ Distance signal includes optional PBRS term
- ✅ No bugs in composition

### Special Modes
- ✅ **Delete-only**: Only delete_reward used
- ✅ **Centroid-only**: Only distance_signal used (with optional PBRS)
- ✅ **Spawn-only**: Only spawn_reward used
- ✅ **Combinations**: Correct subset composition

### Termination Reward Clipping
- ✅ Only applied when `centroid_distance_only_mode=True`
- ✅ Scaled by `dm_term_scale`, clipped to ±`dm_term_clip_val`
- ✅ Only included when `is_normal_mode` or `include_termination_rewards=True`
- ✅ No double-adding, no sign errors

## Configuration Example

To enable centroid PBRS in your config:

```yaml
graph_rewards:
  pbrs_centroid:
    enabled: true
    shaping_coeff: 1.0      # Adjust strength of shaping
    phi_distance_scale: 1.0  # Scale factor for potential

algorithm:
  gamma: 0.99  # Discount factor (used in PBRS)

distance_mode:
  use_delta_distance: true  # Works with both delta and static modes
  distance_reward_scale: 5.0
```

## Performance Impact

- **Computation overhead**: Negligible (~2 potential function calls per step)
- **Memory overhead**: None (no additional state storage)
- **Correctness**: Preserves optimal policy (proven by PBRS theory)

## Backward Compatibility

✅ **Fully backward compatible**:
- Default behavior unchanged (PBRS disabled by default)
- Existing configs work without modification
- Can enable PBRS without breaking existing training

## Conclusion

Both PBRS centroid bugs have been **fixed and validated**:

1. ✅ Centroid potential reads from correct location (`graph_features[3]`)
2. ✅ PBRS shaping integrated into distance_signal calculation
3. ✅ Device-agnostic (CPU/GPU compatible)
4. ✅ All test suites passing (8/8 tests)
5. ✅ No bugs in normal mode or special modes
6. ✅ Termination reward clipping correct

**Status**: **READY FOR TRAINING** with optional PBRS support.

## Technical Notes

### Why PBRS Preserves Optimal Policy

PBRS adds shaping term: `F(s,a,s') = gamma * Phi(s') - Phi(s)`

This transformation:
- Changes Q-values: `Q'(s,a) = Q(s,a) + Phi(s) - gamma * E[Phi(s')]`
- **Preserves optimal policy**: `argmax_a Q'(s,a) = argmax_a Q(s,a)`
- Accelerates learning by providing denser reward signal

### Potential Function Properties

Our centroid potential: `Phi(s) = -scale * (goal_x - centroid_x(s))`

- **Increases** as centroid moves right (closer to goal)
- **Decreases** as centroid moves left (farther from goal)
- Creates positive shaping for rightward movement
- Creates negative shaping for leftward movement

### Integration with Delta Distance Mode

The fix works seamlessly with both modes:

**Delta mode** (`dm_use_delta=True`):
```
distance_signal = dm_dist_scale * (delta_x / goal_x) + PBRS_term
```

**Static mode** (`dm_use_delta=False`):
```
distance_signal = -(goal_x - centroid_x) / goal_x + PBRS_term
```

Both preserve optimal policy and provide useful training signal.

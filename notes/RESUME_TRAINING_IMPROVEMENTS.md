# Resume Training Improvements

## Overview

Enhanced resume training functionality with better checkpoint tracking and clarified episode numbering semantics.

## Changes Made

### 1. Checkpoint Filename Tracking in loss_metrics.json

**File**: `train.py`

**What Changed**:
- Added `self.last_checkpoint_filename` to track the most recently saved checkpoint
- Modified `save_model()` to update `self.last_checkpoint_filename` after saving
- Modified `save_loss_statistics()` to include `checkpoint_filename` in loss metrics

**Why This Matters**:
- You can now see which checkpoint file contains training data for any episode
- Makes it easier to resume from a specific episode by identifying the correct checkpoint
- Example: If loss was computed at episode 432, you know which checkpoint to load

**Example loss_metrics.json**:
```json
[
  {
    "episode": 10,
    "loss": 16560.71,
    "smoothed_loss": 16560.71,
    "checkpoint_filename": "checkpoint_batch1.pt"
  },
  {
    "episode": 432,
    "loss": 8432.15,
    "smoothed_loss": 9123.45,
    "checkpoint_filename": "checkpoint_batch43.pt"
  }
]
```

**Usage**:
1. Check `loss_metrics.json` to find the episode you want to resume from
2. Note the `checkpoint_filename` for that episode
3. Use that checkpoint path in your resume configuration

---

### 2. Clarified Episode Count Semantics

**File**: `train.py`

**What Changed**:
- Added comments clarifying that `episode_count` in checkpoints represents the **next episode to run**
- Updated resume message to say "Resuming from episode X (next episode to run)"
- Added comment in checkpoint save explaining the semantics

**Episode Count Semantics**:
```
Checkpoint saved after episode 432 completes:
  - episode_count = 433 (next episode to run)
  - Episodes 0-432 are completed
  - When resuming, training starts at episode 433
```

**Why This Matters**:
- Eliminates confusion about whether episode numbers are 0-based or 1-based
- Makes it clear that you won't re-run an already completed episode
- Checkpoint always represents "ready for next episode" state

### 3. Verified Resume Flags Work Correctly

**Flags Tested**:

#### `resume_from_best` (Boolean, default: False)
- **False**: Loads the checkpoint specified in `checkpoint_path`
- **True**: Ignores `checkpoint_path` and loads the most recent `best_model*.pt` file

**Example**:
```yaml
resume_training:
  enabled: true
  checkpoint_path: checkpoint_batch50.pt
  resume_from_best: true  # Will load best_model*.pt instead
```

#### `reset_optimizer` (Boolean, default: False)
- **False**: Restores optimizer state from checkpoint (continues with same learning rate, momentum, etc.)
- **True**: Uses fresh optimizer initialization (as if starting training from scratch, but with trained weights)

**When to use**:
- `reset_optimizer: false` - Normal resume (recommended)
- `reset_optimizer: true` - Fine-tuning with different learning rate

**Example**:
```yaml
resume_training:
  enabled: true
  checkpoint_path: checkpoint_batch50.pt
  reset_optimizer: true  # Fresh optimizer, trained weights
```

#### `reset_episode_count` (Boolean, default: False)
- **False**: Resumes from checkpoint's episode number (continues counting)
- **True**: Resets episode counter to 0 (useful for fine-tuning experiments)

**Example**:
```yaml
resume_training:
  enabled: true
  checkpoint_path: best_model_batch30.pt
  reset_episode_count: true  # Start counting from episode 0 again
```

---

## Verification

**Test Suite**: `tools/test_resume_flags.py`

Run the test suite to verify all resume functionality:
```bash
python tools/test_resume_flags.py
```

**Tests Included**:
1. ‚úÖ Checkpoint structure verification
2. ‚úÖ Episode count semantics (next episode to run)
3. ‚úÖ `reset_episode_count` flag behavior
4. ‚úÖ `reset_optimizer` flag behavior
5. ‚úÖ `resume_from_best` flag behavior
6. ‚úÖ loss_metrics.json checkpoint tracking

**All tests pass** ‚úÖ

## Common Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Normal Resume (Continue Training)
```yaml
resume_training:
  enabled: true
  checkpoint_path: training_results/run0002/checkpoint_batch50.pt
  resume_from_best: false
  reset_optimizer: false
  reset_episode_count: false
```
**Result**: Continues training from episode 500 (if batch size = 10) with same optimizer state

### Use Case 2: Resume from Best Model
```yaml
resume_training:
  enabled: true
  checkpoint_path: training_results/run0002/checkpoint_batch50.pt  # Ignored
  resume_from_best: true
  reset_optimizer: false
  reset_episode_count: false
```
**Result**: Loads best model and continues training from its episode

### Use Case 3: Fine-Tuning with Fresh Optimizer
```yaml
resume_training:
  enabled: true
  checkpoint_path: training_results/run0002/best_model_batch30.pt
  resume_from_best: false
  reset_optimizer: true
  reset_episode_count: false
```
**Result**: Uses trained weights but fresh optimizer (for different learning rate schedule)

### Use Case 4: Transfer Learning (New Episode Count)
```yaml
resume_training:
  enabled: true
  checkpoint_path: pretrained_model.pt
  resume_from_best: false
  reset_optimizer: true
  reset_episode_count: true
```
**Result**: Starts from episode 0 with trained weights and fresh optimizer (good for new experiments)

## Finding the Right Checkpoint

### Method 1: Using loss_metrics.json
```bash
# Find episode 432's checkpoint
cat training_results/run0002/loss_metrics.json | grep -A1 '"episode": 432'
```
**Output**:
```json
{
  "episode": 432,
  "loss": 8432.15,
  "smoothed_loss": 9123.45,
  "checkpoint_filename": "checkpoint_batch43.pt"
}
```
**Use**: `checkpoint_path: training_results/run0002/checkpoint_batch43.pt`

### Method 2: Best Model
```bash
# Find best model
ls -lh training_results/run0002/best_model*.pt
```
**Use**: `resume_from_best: true` (automatically finds it)

### Method 3: Latest Checkpoint
```bash
# Find most recent checkpoint
ls -lt training_results/run0002/checkpoint*.pt | head -1
```

## Impact on Other Files

### plotter.py
**Status**: ‚úÖ No changes needed

**Why**: `plotter.py` uses `extract_loss_metrics()` which reads `episode`, `loss`, and `smoothed_loss` fields. The new `checkpoint_filename` field is optional and ignored by the plotter. Future enhancements could display checkpoint info on plots.

### config.yaml
**Status**: ‚úÖ No changes needed

**Why**: Resume flags already existed in config schema. Documentation improved but no schema changes.

---

## Backward Compatibility

‚úÖ **Fully backward compatible**

- Old checkpoints without the tracking work fine (just won't have checkpoint filename in loss_metrics.json)
- Old loss_metrics.json files without checkpoint_filename still work
- plotter.py ignores the new field
- All existing resume configurations continue to work

---

## Summary

**What You Get**:
1. üéØ Know which checkpoint contains any episode's training data
2. üìç Clear understanding of episode numbering (next episode to run)
3. ‚úÖ Verified resume flags work correctly
4. üß™ Test suite to ensure correctness
5. üìñ Clear documentation for all use cases

**Example Workflow**:
```bash
# 1. Check loss at episode 432
cat training_results/run0002/loss_metrics.json | jq '.[] | select(.episode==432)'

# 2. See checkpoint filename
# Output: "checkpoint_filename": "checkpoint_batch43.pt"

# 3. Resume from that checkpoint
python train_cli.py \
  --resume \
  --checkpoint training_results/run0002/checkpoint_batch43.pt \
  --no-reset-episode-count

# 4. Training continues from episode 433
```

üéâ **Resume training is now more transparent and easier to manage!**

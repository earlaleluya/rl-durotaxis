# Docstring Verification Summary

**Date**: 2024-10-30  
**Status**: ✅ ALL DOCSTRINGS CORRECTED  
**Files Updated**: `actor_critic.py`, `train.py`

## Overview

All docstrings have been updated to accurately reflect the **delete ratio architecture** and remove references to the old discrete per-node action system.

## Files Updated

### 1. actor_critic.py

#### Module-Level Docstring
**Before**: Referenced "Discrete actions: spawn/delete decisions per node"  
**After**: 
```python
"""
Delete Ratio Actor-Critic Network for Durotaxis Environment

This module implements a decoupled actor-critic architecture that handles:
1. Single global continuous action: [delete_ratio, gamma, alpha, noise, theta]
   - delete_ratio: fraction of leftmost nodes to delete (0.0 to 0.5)
   - gamma, alpha, noise, theta: spawn parameters applied to all non-deleted nodes
2. Multi-component value estimation for different reward components
3. Graph neural network integration via GraphInputEncoder
4. Pre-trained ResNet backbone for enhanced feature extraction and stability

The architecture is designed to work with the durotaxis environment's
reward component dictionary structure for flexible learning updates.

Architecture Strategy:
- Processes all nodes through ResNet backbone
- Aggregates node features via mean pooling
- Outputs single global action vector (not per-node actions)
- Delete ratio determines which nodes to delete based on x-position sorting
"""
```

#### Critic Class Docstring
**Before**: "The Critic network for the Hybrid Actor-Critic agent."  
**After**:
```python
"""
The Critic network for the Delete Ratio Actor-Critic agent.

Processes graph-level features through ResNet backbone to estimate state values
for different reward components. Works with the delete ratio architecture where
actions are global (not per-node).
"""
```

#### HybridActorCritic Class Docstring
**Before**: "Decoupled Hybrid Actor-Critic network for the durotaxis environment."  
**After**:
```python
"""
Delete Ratio Actor-Critic network for the durotaxis environment.

This class orchestrates the GraphInputEncoder, Actor, and Critic modules
to produce a single global continuous action vector: [delete_ratio, gamma, alpha, noise, theta].

Delete Ratio Strategy:
- Actor outputs one action for the entire graph (not per-node)
- delete_ratio determines fraction of leftmost nodes to delete
- Remaining nodes spawn with global parameters (gamma, alpha, noise, theta)
- Critic evaluates graph-level state values
"""
```

#### forward() Method Docstring
**Before**: "Forward pass through the hybrid actor-critic network."  
**After**:
```python
"""
Forward pass through the delete ratio actor-critic network.

Args:
    state_dict: Graph state containing node_features, graph_features, edge_attr, edge_index
    deterministic: If True, return mean actions; if False, sample from distributions
    action_mask: Unused in delete ratio architecture (kept for API compatibility)

Returns:
    Dictionary containing:
    - continuous_mu: Mean of continuous action distribution [5]
    - continuous_std: Std of continuous action distribution [5]
    - continuous_actions: Sampled or deterministic actions [delete_ratio, gamma, alpha, noise, theta]
    - value_predictions: Dict of value estimates for each component
    - encoder_out: Graph and node embeddings
"""
```

#### HybridPolicyAgent Class Docstring
**Before**: "Agent wrapper for the HybridActorCritic network."  
**After**:
```python
"""
Agent wrapper for the Delete Ratio Actor-Critic network.

Converts network output (single global action) into topology operations:
- Sorts nodes by x-position
- Deletes leftmost nodes based on delete_ratio
- Spawns from remaining nodes using global spawn parameters
"""
```

### 2. train.py

#### Module-Level Docstring
**Before**: "Practical Training Loop for Hybrid Actor-Critic with Multi-Component Rewards"  
**After**:
```python
"""
Training Loop for Delete Ratio Actor-Critic with Multi-Component Rewards

A streamlined training implementation for the delete ratio architecture:
1. Single global continuous action: [delete_ratio, gamma, alpha, noise, theta]
2. Component-specific value learning with reward system
3. Efficient experience collection and policy updates
4. Progressive learning with reward component weighting
5. Two-stage training: delete_ratio only → all parameters

Delete Ratio Strategy:
- Stage 1: Train only delete_ratio (freeze spawn parameters)
- Stage 2: Train all 5 parameters together
- Delete leftmost nodes based on x-position sorting
- Apply global spawn parameters to remaining nodes
"""
```

#### DurotaxisTrainer Class Docstring
**Before**: "Streamlined trainer for hybrid actor-critic with component rewards"  
**After**:
```python
"""
Trainer for Delete Ratio Actor-Critic with component rewards.

Implements two-stage training:
- Stage 1: Train delete_ratio only (freeze spawn parameters)
- Stage 2: Train all 5 parameters [delete_ratio, gamma, alpha, noise, theta]

Uses PPO with multi-component value learning and reward weighting.

### 3. durotaxis_env.py

**Status**: ✅ No changes needed  
The environment docstring correctly mentions "Discrete action space (dummy - actual actions determined by policy network)" which accurately describes that the gym.Discrete(1) is just a placeholder.

---

## Verification Results

### Compilation Check
```bash
✅ All files compile successfully
```

### Remaining Mentions of "per-node" or "discrete"
All remaining mentions are **correct clarifications** that actions are NOT per-node:
- `actor_critic.py:18`: "Outputs single global action vector (not per-node actions)" ✅
- `actor_critic.py:244`: "actions are global (not per-node)" ✅
- `actor_critic.py:328`: "Actor outputs one action for the entire graph (not per-node)" ✅
- `durotaxis_env.py:137`: "Discrete action space (dummy - actual actions determined by policy network)" ✅

## Key Changes Summary

| File | Lines Changed | Key Updates |
|------|---------------|-------------|
| `actor_critic.py` | ~50 | Module, class, and method docstrings updated to reflect delete ratio architecture |
| `train.py` | ~20 | Module and class docstrings updated to describe two-stage training |
| `durotaxis_env.py` | 0 | No changes needed - already correct |

## Architecture Documentation

### Delete Ratio Action Space
```python
action = [delete_ratio, gamma, alpha, noise, theta]
# Shape: [5]
# Type: Continuous (not discrete)
# Scope: Global (not per-node)
```

**Components**:
1. `delete_ratio` ∈ [0.0, 0.5]: Fraction of leftmost nodes to delete
2. `gamma` ∈ [0.5, 15.0]: Substrate influence strength
3. `alpha` ∈ [0.5, 4.0]: Directional bias magnitude
4. `noise` ∈ [0.05, 0.5]: Random perturbation level
5. `theta` ∈ [-π/4, π/4]: Angular direction for spawning

### Strategy
1. Sort nodes by x-position (ascending)
2. Delete leftmost `delete_ratio × num_nodes` nodes
3. Spawn from remaining nodes using global parameters (γ, α, noise, θ)
4. All spawns use the same parameters (not per-node)

## Conclusion

✅ **All docstrings have been verified and corrected**

The codebase documentation now accurately reflects:
1. Delete ratio architecture (not discrete per-node actions)
2. Single global continuous action vector
3. Two-stage training strategy
4. Delete strategy based on x-position sorting

No further docstring updates needed.

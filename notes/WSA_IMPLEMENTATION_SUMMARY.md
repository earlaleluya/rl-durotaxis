# WSA Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Weight Sharing Attention (WSA) Architecture
- **Multi-PTM Feature Extraction**: Combines features from multiple pre-trained models
- **Dynamic Attention**: Learns to weight PTM contributions based on state context
- **Configurable**: Easy toggle between standard Actor and WSA-Enhanced Actor

### 2. Supported Pre-Trained Models
- **ResNet18**: Fast, lightweight (11M parameters)
- **ResNet34**: Medium capacity (21M parameters)  
- **ResNet50**: High capacity (25M parameters)
- **Graph-CNN**: Custom architecture for graph data
- **Weight Options**: ImageNet pre-trained or random initialization

### 3. Configuration System
```yaml
actor_critic:
  wsa:
    enabled: true/false  # Toggle WSA on/off
    
    pretrained_models:
      - name: resnet18_imagenet
        model_type: resnet18
        weights: imagenet
        freeze_backbone: true
    
    attention:
      hidden_dim: 128
      dropout: 0.1
    
    logging:
      log_attention_weights: true
      log_features: true
```

## Architecture Comparison

### Standard Actor
```

    ↓
Graph Encoder (GNN)
    ↓

    ↓

```

## Benefits of WSA

1. **Feature Diversity**: Multiple PTMs capture different aspects
2. **Adaptive Learning**: Attention adjusts based on state context
3. **Robustness**: Ensemble effect reduces reliance on single model
4. **Flexibility**: Easy to add/remove PTMs via config
5. **Interpretability**: Attention weights show PTM contributions

## Performance Expectations

### Hypothesis
WSA should outperform standard Actor by:
- Capturing complementary features from diverse PTMs
- Dynamically emphasizing relevant features per state
- Leveraging both pre-trained knowledge and task-specific learning

### Expected Improvements
- **Sample Efficiency**: Faster learning due to pre-trained features
- **Final Performance**: Better asymptotic reward
- **Generalization**: More robust to environment variations

### Potential Trade-offs
- **Computational Cost**: More PTMs = more computation
- **Training Time**: Additional parameters to learn
- **Complexity**: More hyperparameters to tune

## Monitoring WSA During Training

### Attention Weight Evolution
```python
# Check TensorBoard
tensorboard --logdir runs/

# Look for:
# - wsa/attention_weights_0  (PTM 0 weight)
# - wsa/attention_weights_1  (PTM 1 weight)
# - wsa/attention_weights_2  (PTM 2 weight)
# - wsa/attention_entropy    (attention diversity)
```

### Feature Quality
```python
# Check feature norms
# - wsa/feature_norms_0  (PTM 0 feature magnitude)
# - wsa/feature_norms_1  (PTM 1 feature magnitude)
# - wsa/feature_norms_2  (PTM 2 feature magnitude)
```

### Healthy Attention Patterns
✅ **Balanced**: All PTMs get 20-40% attention
✅ **Dynamic**: Weights change during training
✅ **Meaningful**: Different states → different attention distributions

### Warning Signs
⚠️ **Collapsed**: One PTM gets >90% attention always
⚠️ **Static**: Weights don't change during training
⚠️ **Random**: Attention distribution noisy/unstable

## Ablation Study Recommendations

### Phase 1: Baseline Comparison
1. Standard Actor (ResNet18 ImageNet)
2. WSA-3 (ResNet18 + Graph-CNN + ResNet18 Random)

### Phase 2: PTM Type
1. All ImageNet weights
2. All Random weights
3. Mixed (1 ImageNet + 2 Random)

### Phase 3: Architecture Diversity
1. Same architecture (3x ResNet18)
2. Mixed ResNets (ResNet18/34/50)
3. Hybrid (ResNet + Graph-CNN)

### Phase 4: Number of PTMs
1. WSA-2 (2 PTMs)
2. WSA-3 (3 PTMs)
3. WSA-4 (4 PTMs)

## Technical Details

### Memory Requirements
- **Standard Actor**: ~11M parameters (ResNet18)
- **WSA-3 (default)**: ~33M parameters (3x ResNet18 + attention)
- **WSA-3 (frozen)**: ~11M trainable (only attention + heads trainable)

### Computational Overhead
- **Standard Actor**: 1x ResNet18 forward pass
- **WSA-3**: 3x ResNet18 forward passes + attention (3-4x slower)

### Recommended Configuration
For fastest training while maintaining diversity:
```yaml
pretrained_models:
  - name: resnet18_imagenet
    model_type: resnet18
    weights: imagenet
    freeze_backbone: true  # Freeze pre-trained
  
  - name: graph_cnn
    model_type: graph_cnn
    weights: null
    freeze_backbone: false  # Train from scratch
  
  - name: resnet18_random
    model_type: resnet18
    weights: random
    freeze_backbone: false  # Train from scratch
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: WSA not loading
**Check**: `wsa.enabled: true` in config.yaml
**Check**: `pretrained_fusion.py` exists and is importable

### Issue: CUDA OOM with WSA
**Solution**: Reduce batch size or use smaller PTMs (ResNet18 only)
**Solution**: Freeze more backbones
**Solution**: Reduce number of PTMs

### Issue: Attention not learning
**Check**: Attention learning rate (should be similar to actor LR)
**Check**: Features are diverse (different PTMs producing different outputs)
**Try**: Increase attention hidden_dim

### Issue: One PTM dominates
**Try**: Use more diverse PTM configurations
**Try**: Pre-train attention with equal weights
**Check**: Feature norms are balanced

## Code Quality Assurance

### Testing
```bash
# Test WSA configuration
python test_wsa_config.py

# Expected output:
# ✅ ALL TESTS PASSED
# ✅ Standard Actor: Ready for baseline comparison
# ✅ WSA-Enhanced Actor: Ready for enhanced learning
# ✅ Custom PTMs: Flexible configuration working
```

### Device Agnostic
All code works on both CPU and CUDA:
```python
device = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')
```

### Gradient Checkpointing
Large graphs (500+ nodes) use checkpointing to save memory:
```python
if num_nodes > 500:
    features = checkpoint(self.resnet_body, grid_input)
```

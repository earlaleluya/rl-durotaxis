# Numerical Stability Fixes - Comprehensive Solution

## Problem Summary

Training was experiencing:
- **NaN values** causing crashes or silent failures
- **No learning** (flat loss, no gradient updates)
- **Short episodes** (5-10 steps, graph collapse)
- **Low node counts** (stuck at 1-2 nodes)

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Unstable logits**: Large values causing overflow in softmax/exp operations
2. **Masked logits normalization**: Conditional normalization was preserving extreme values
3. **Missing NaN checks**: NaN propagating through network without detection
4. **Continuous log-prob issues**: Unbounded actions causing extreme log probabilities
5. **Standard deviation issues**: Too small or too large std causing numerical issues

---

## Fixes Applied

### 1. **Rewritten `_safe_masked_logits()` - Most Critical Fix**

**Location**: `actor_critic.py` (top of file)

**What Changed**:
```python
# BEFORE: Conditional normalization (only when |logits| > 20)
# This preserved extreme values during normal operation

# AFTER: Always apply max-subtraction (standard softmax stabilization)
def _safe_masked_logits(logits, action_mask):
    # 1. Aggressive NaN/Inf cleaning at entry
    masked = torch.nan_to_num(logits, nan=0.0, posinf=30.0, neginf=-30.0)
    
    # 2. Apply mask (-inf for invalid actions)
    if action_mask is not None:
        masked = masked.masked_fill(~mask, float('-inf'))
        
    # 3. Handle all-invalid rows (fallback to uniform)
    all_invalid = torch.isinf(masked).all(dim=1)
    if all_invalid.any():
        masked[all_invalid] = 0.0
        
    # 4. Standard max-subtraction (ALWAYS applied for stability)
    row_max = masked.max(dim=1, keepdim=True).values
    masked = masked - torch.nan_to_num(row_max, nan=0.0)
    
    # 5. Final safety clamp
    masked = torch.clamp(masked, -30.0, 0.0)
    
    return masked
```

**Why This Works**:
- **Max-subtraction** is the standard approach to prevent `exp(large_number) = inf` in softmax
- After subtraction, largest logit is 0, preventing overflow
- Still preserves relative differences (softmax is translation-invariant)
- Aggressive NaN cleaning at multiple stages

---

### 2. **Strengthened Actor.forward() Output Sanitization**

**Location**: `actor_critic.py`, `Actor.forward()` method

**What Changed**:
```python
# Enhanced shared features check
if torch.isnan(shared_features).any() or torch.isinf(shared_features).any():
    print("⚠️  WARNING: NaN/Inf detected in Actor shared_features! Sanitizing...")
    shared_features = torch.nan_to_num(shared_features, nan=0.0, posinf=10.0, neginf=-10.0)

# Tighter clamping
discrete_logits = torch.clamp(discrete_logits, -30.0, 30.0)  # Was -20/20

# Final NaN check before returning
discrete_logits = torch.nan_to_num(discrete_logits, nan=0.0)
continuous_mu = torch.nan_to_num(continuous_mu, nan=0.0)
continuous_logstd = torch.nan_to_num(continuous_logstd, nan=0.0)
```

**Why This Works**:
- Catches NaN/Inf at the ResNet output (common failure point)
- Tighter bounds prevent extreme values before masking
- Final NaN check ensures clean outputs

---

### 3. **Enhanced evaluate_actions() Safety**

**Location**: `actor_critic.py`, `HybridActorCritic.evaluate_actions()` method

**What Changed**:
```python
# Ensure std is not too small (avoid extreme log-probs)
continuous_std = torch.clamp(continuous_std, min=1e-6, max=10.0)

# Clamp actions before computing log_prob
continuous_actions_clamped = torch.clamp(continuous_actions, -10.0, 10.0)
continuous_log_probs = continuous_dist.log_prob(continuous_actions_clamped).sum(dim=-1)

# Clamp log_probs to prevent extreme values
discrete_log_probs = torch.clamp(discrete_log_probs, -20.0, 20.0)
continuous_log_probs = torch.clamp(continuous_log_probs, -20.0, 20.0)

# Final NaN check
discrete_log_probs = torch.nan_to_num(discrete_log_probs, nan=0.0)
continuous_log_probs = torch.nan_to_num(continuous_log_probs, nan=0.0)
```

**Why This Works**:
- Prevents division by zero or near-zero in Normal distribution
- Clamps actions to reasonable range before log_prob (mitigates missing log-derivative issue)
- Prevents extreme negative log_probs that cause gradient explosion

### 4. **Additional Fixes from Previous Session**

**Learnable Spawn Bias**:
```yaml
# config.yaml
actor_critic:
  spawn_bias_init: 0.2  # Small positive bias toward spawning
```

**Advantage Normalization**:
```python
# train.py - TrajectoryBuffer.compute_returns_and_advantages_for_all_episodes()
adv_tensor = torch.stack(advantages)
adv_mean = adv_tensor.mean()
adv_std = adv_tensor.std(unbiased=False)
adv_std = adv_std if adv_std > 1e-8 else torch.tensor(1.0)
adv_norm = (adv_tensor - adv_mean) / adv_std
```

**Action Mask Diagnostics**:
```python
# train.py - create_action_mask()
if torch.all(~mask, dim=1).float().mean() > 0.2:
    print("⚠️  WARNING: Over 20% of nodes have no valid actions.")
```

## Key Numerical Stability Principles Applied

### ✅ **Defensive Programming**
- NaN/Inf checks at every critical junction
- Aggressive sanitization: `torch.nan_to_num()` everywhere
- Multiple layers of protection

### ✅ **Standard Stabilization Techniques**
- **Max-subtraction** in softmax (prevents overflow)
- **Log-space arithmetic** (PyTorch's Categorical does this internally)
- **Clamping** before exponentials and logarithms

### ✅ **Distribution Safety**
- Ensure `std > 1e-6` (prevent division by zero)
- Clamp `logstd` to `[-10, 5]` (prevent extreme variances)
- Clamp `log_probs` to `[-20, 20]` (prevent gradient explosion)

### ✅ **Action Bounding**
- Clamp unbounded actions before `log_prob` computation
- Use `tanh` for circular bounds (theta)
- Use `sigmoid` for positive bounds (gamma, alpha, noise)

---

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

### ✅ **What You Should See**

**Training Metrics**:
- ✅ Episodes lasting **50-200+ steps** (not 5-10)
- ✅ Node counts **growing** within episodes (5 → 10 → 20+)
- ✅ Loss **fluctuating and trending down** over minibatches
- ✅ Policy loss and value loss both **showing movement**

**Diagnostic Messages**:
- ✅ No NaN warnings (or very rare)
- ✅ No "Over 20% of nodes have no valid actions" warnings
- ✅ Clean training logs without crashes

**Learning Signs**:
- ✅ Increasing episode lengths over first 20-50 episodes
- ✅ Spawn actions occurring (not all delete)
- ✅ Rewards improving (less negative or more positive)

### ❌ **Warning Signs to Watch**

If you still see:
- **"NaN/Inf detected in Actor shared_features"** → ResNet may need lower learning rate
- **"Over 20% nodes have no valid actions"** → Action mask logic too restrictive
- **Short episodes persist** → Increase `spawn_bias_init` to 0.3 or 0.4
- **Loss still flat** → Check reward scaling, may need to increase `spawn_success_reward`

---

## Testing Instructions

### 1. **Run Short Training Test**
```bash
conda activate durotaxis
python train.py
```

### 2. **Monitor First 20 Episodes**

Watch for these metrics in the output:
```
Episode    1: R=XXX | MB=X | Steps=XX | Success=XXX | Loss=XXX
Episode    5: R=XXX | MB=X | Steps=XX | Success=XXX | Loss=XXX
Episode   10: R=XXX | MB=X | Steps=XX | Success=XXX | Loss=XXX
Episode   20: R=XXX | MB=X | Steps=XX | Success=XXX | Loss=XXX
```

**Good Signs**:
- `Steps` increasing (e.g., 5 → 10 → 20 → 50)
- `Loss` changing (not stuck at same value)
- No crash or NaN errors

**Bad Signs**:
- `Steps` stuck at 5-10
- `Loss` identical across episodes
- Frequent NaN warnings

### 3. **Check Training Logs**
```bash
# Look for warnings
grep "WARNING" training_results/run*/training_log.txt

# Check episode progression
tail -50 training_results/run*/training_log.txt
```

---

## Tuning Parameters (If Needed)

### **If Episodes Still Too Short**

```yaml
# config.yaml

# Increase spawn bias
actor_critic:
  spawn_bias_init: 0.3  # Up from 0.2

# Increase spawn rewards
environment:
  spawn_rewards:
    spawn_success_reward: 4.0  # Up from 2.5
```

### **If Learning Still Unstable**

```yaml
# config.yaml

# Reduce learning rate
trainer:
  learning_rate: 0.0001  # Down from 0.0002

# Reduce entropy bonus
trainer:
  entropy_bonus_coeff: 0.02  # Down from 0.03

# Tighter gradient clipping
algorithm:
  max_grad_norm: 0.3  # Down from 0.5
```

### **If NaN Warnings Persist**

```yaml
# config.yaml

# Even tighter clamping (requires code edit)
# In actor_critic.py Actor.forward():
discrete_logits = torch.clamp(discrete_logits, -20.0, 20.0)  # Reduce from 30

# Lower dropout (reduce regularization stress)
actor_critic:
  dropout_rate: 0.1  # Down from 0.2
```

## Technical Notes

### **Why Max-Subtraction Works**

Softmax is translation-invariant:
$$\text{softmax}(x_i) = \frac{e^{x_i}}{\sum_j e^{x_j}} = \frac{e^{x_i - c}}{\sum_j e^{x_j - c}}$$

Setting $c = \max(x)$ ensures:
- Largest exponent is $e^0 = 1$ (no overflow)
- All other exponents are $< 1$ (no underflow to 0)

### **Continuous Action Log-Prob Approximation**

The current implementation computes:
$$\log \pi(a | s) = \log \mathcal{N}(\mu(s), \sigma(s))$$

But the actual action is bounded: $a = g(a_{\text{raw}})$ where $g$ is sigmoid/tanh.

**Proper formula** (Squashed Gaussian):
$$\log \pi(a | s) = \log \mathcal{N}(a_{\text{raw}} | \mu, \sigma) - \log |g'(a_{\text{raw}})|$$

**Current approximation**: We skip the $\log |g'(a_{\text{raw}})|$ term.

**Mitigation**: Clamping actions to $[-10, 10]$ before log_prob reduces the error from this approximation.

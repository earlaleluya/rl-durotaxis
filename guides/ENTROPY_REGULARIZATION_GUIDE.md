# Enhanced Entropy Regularization System

## Overview

The enhanced entropy regularization system implements **adaptive exploration control** to prevent premature policy collapse in hybrid discrete-continuous action spaces. This builds on your core insight with sophisticated scheduling and action-space-specific handling.

## Problem Solved

**Original Issue**: Policy collapse in hybrid action spaces:
- Discrete actions (topology decisions) require high exploration
- Continuous parameters (spawn parameters) need balanced exploration
- Fixed entropy coefficients don't adapt to training phases
- Risk of premature convergence to suboptimal policies

**Your Original Insight**: Add entropy regularization:
```python
entropy = eval_output['action_distribution'].entropy().mean()
entropy_coef = 0.01
total_loss -= entropy_coef * entropy
```

## Enhanced Solution: Three-Tier Adaptive System

### Tier 1: Adaptive Entropy Scheduling 📈
**Smart exploration decay over training**
```python
def compute_adaptive_entropy_coefficient(self, episode: int) -> float:
    if episode < self.entropy_decay_episodes:
        progress = episode / self.entropy_decay_episodes
        current_coeff = self.entropy_coeff_start * (1 - progress) + self.entropy_coeff_end * progress
    else:
        current_coeff = self.entropy_coeff_end
    return current_coeff
```
- **Purpose**: High exploration early → focused exploitation later
- **Benefit**: Prevents both under-exploration and over-exploration

### Tier 2: Action-Space-Specific Weighting 🎯
**Different entropy needs for different actions**
```python
# Discrete actions (topology): High entropy weight (1.0)
discrete_loss = -entropy_coeff * self.discrete_entropy_weight * discrete_entropy

# Continuous actions (parameters): Lower entropy weight (0.5)  
continuous_loss = -entropy_coeff * self.continuous_entropy_weight * continuous_entropy
```
- **Purpose**: Topology decisions need more exploration than parameter fine-tuning
- **Benefit**: Balanced exploration across action types

### Tier 3: Policy Collapse Prevention 🛡️
**Emergency intervention when entropy gets too low**
```python
if discrete_entropy < self.min_entropy_threshold:
    discrete_penalty = (self.min_entropy_threshold - discrete_entropy) * 3.0
    entropy_losses['discrete_penalty'] = discrete_penalty
```
- **Purpose**: Hard protection against complete policy collapse
- **Benefit**: Maintains minimum exploration throughout training

## Performance Results

### Adaptive Entropy Scheduling:
```
Episode    0: entropy_coeff = 0.100000  (high exploration)
Episode  100: entropy_coeff = 0.080200  (reducing)
Episode  250: entropy_coeff = 0.050500  (moderate)  
Episode  500: entropy_coeff = 0.001000  (low exploration)
Episode  750: entropy_coeff = 0.001000  (stable)
Episode 1000: entropy_coeff = 0.001000  (focused)
```

### Policy Collapse Detection:
```
Normal entropy:
  discrete: -0.064160      (healthy exploration)
  continuous: -0.044110    (balanced)
  total: -0.108270

Low entropy (collapse risk):
  discrete: -0.004277      (dangerously low)
  discrete_penalty: 0.140000  (emergency intervention!)
  continuous: -0.040100    (still healthy)
  total: 0.095623         (net penalty to boost exploration)
```

## Configuration Options

```yaml
# In config.yaml
trainer:
  entropy_regularization:
    enable_adaptive_entropy: true     # Enable adaptive entropy scheduling
    entropy_coeff_start: 0.1          # Starting entropy coefficient (high exploration)
    entropy_coeff_end: 0.001          # Ending entropy coefficient (low exploration)
    entropy_decay_episodes: 500       # Episodes over which to decay entropy
    discrete_entropy_weight: 1.0      # Weight for discrete action entropy
    continuous_entropy_weight: 0.5    # Weight for continuous action entropy
    min_entropy_threshold: 0.1        # Minimum entropy to prevent collapse
```

## Key Algorithm Features

### 1. Smart Scheduling
```python
# Linear decay from high to low exploration
progress = episode / entropy_decay_episodes
current_coeff = start_coeff * (1 - progress) + end_coeff * progress
```

### 2. Hybrid Action Handling
```python
# Different weights for different action types
discrete_loss = -entropy_coeff * discrete_weight * discrete_entropy
continuous_loss = -entropy_coeff * continuous_weight * continuous_entropy
```

### 3. Emergency Protection
```python
# Prevent catastrophic policy collapse
if entropy < threshold:
    penalty = (threshold - entropy) * penalty_multiplier
    total_loss += penalty  # Force more exploration
```

### 4. Comprehensive Monitoring
```python
entropy_losses = {
    'total': combined_entropy_loss,
    'discrete': discrete_entropy_loss,
    'continuous': continuous_entropy_loss,
    'discrete_penalty': collapse_prevention_penalty,
    'continuous_penalty': continuous_collapse_penalty
}
```

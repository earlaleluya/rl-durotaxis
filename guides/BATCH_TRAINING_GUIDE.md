# Batch Training System for Enhanced RL Stability

## Overview

The batch training system transforms your RL training from **single-episode updates** to **sophisticated batch updates**, dramatically improving training stability and sample efficiency. This addresses the core problem you identified: training variance and poor sample utilization.

## Problem Solved

**Original Issue**: Single-episode updates cause:
- **High Variance**: Policy updates from single episodes are very noisy
- **Poor Sample Efficiency**: Each experience used only once
- **Unstable Learning**: Policy changes too quickly from one episode
- **Unreliable Gradients**: Single-episode gradients are inconsistent

**Your Core Insight**: *"Collect trajectories for several episodes, then sample minibatches during updates"*

## Enhanced Solution: Three-Phase Batch Training 🎯

### Phase 1: Rollout Collection 📊
**Collect multiple episodes before updating**
```python
# Collect rollout_batch_size episodes (default: 10)
for batch_episode in range(self.rollout_batch_size):
    states, actions, rewards, values, log_probs, final_values, terminated, success = self.collect_episode()
    self.trajectory_buffer.add_episode(...)
```
- **Purpose**: Accumulate diverse experiences before learning
- **Benefit**: Reduces gradient noise from single episode variance

### Phase 2: Advantage Computation 🧮
**Compute returns and advantages for all episodes at once**
```python
self.trajectory_buffer.compute_returns_and_advantages_for_all_episodes(gamma, gae_lambda)
```
- **Purpose**: Consistent GAE computation across entire batch
- **Benefit**: Better advantage estimates from larger data context

### Phase 3: Multi-Epoch Minibatch Updates 🔄
**Multiple update epochs with random minibatches**
```python
for epoch in range(self.update_epochs):  # Default: 4 epochs
    minibatches = self.trajectory_buffer.create_minibatches(self.minibatch_size)  # Default: 64
    for minibatch in minibatches:
        losses = self.update_policy_minibatch(minibatch['states'], ...)
```
- **Purpose**: Stable gradients through repeated learning from shuffled data
- **Benefit**: Better sample efficiency and smoother convergence

## Key Algorithm Components

### 1. TrajectoryBuffer Class 📦
**Smart episode storage and batching**
```python
class TrajectoryBuffer:
    def start_episode(self):
        # Initialize new episode storage
        
    def add_step(self, state, action, reward, value, log_prob):
        # Store individual step data
        
    def finish_episode(self, final_values, terminated, success):
        # Complete episode and add to buffer
        
    def create_minibatches(self, minibatch_size):
        # Generate random minibatches for training
```

### 2. Enhanced Training Loop 🔄
**Batch-first collection and update pattern**
```python
while episode_count < self.total_episodes:
    # PHASE 1: Collect rollout batch
    self.trajectory_buffer.clear()
    for batch_episode in range(self.rollout_batch_size):
        episode_data = self.collect_episode()
        self.trajectory_buffer.add_episode(episode_data)
    
    # PHASE 2: Compute advantages for all episodes
    self.trajectory_buffer.compute_returns_and_advantages_for_all_episodes(gamma, gae_lambda)
    
    # PHASE 3: Multiple update epochs with minibatches
    for epoch in range(self.update_epochs):
        minibatches = self.trajectory_buffer.create_minibatches(self.minibatch_size)
        for minibatch in minibatches:
            losses = self.update_policy_minibatch(minibatch)
```

### 3. Minibatch Policy Updates 🎯
**Efficient minibatch processing**
```python
def update_policy_minibatch(self, states, actions, returns, advantages, old_log_probs, episode):
    # Convert minibatch data to component-wise format
    # Call original update_policy with proper data structure
    return self.update_policy(states, actions, returns_dict, advantages_dict, old_log_probs, episode)
```

## Configuration Options

```yaml
# In config.yaml
